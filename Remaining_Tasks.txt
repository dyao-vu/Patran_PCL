Tasks to Complete: Patran_Model.pcl

1. Complete the parsing to support all the constructs in:

Note: Some of the keywords changes.  e.g. Composite_2D_Layup change to Material_Layup

2. Create a function to log the contents of the im-memory data structures

3. Create a funcdtion to check the in-memory data structures.  For example, in the following:

Solid
	ID = 2
	Element_Type = TETRA8
	Material_ID = 1
	Mesh_Parameters_ID = 1

There must be a 
Material
	ID = 1
	Tropic_Type = ISOTROPIC
	Name = steel_stainless_321
	Description = stainless steel 321
	Youngs_Modulus = 1.99941E8
	Poissons_Ratio = .21
	Density = 7.82701E-6
	Therm_Expan_Coef = 1.11E-5	

with a ID = 1
In other words is there is a reference to another entity, that referenced entity must exists.

4. Read parsolid model  // There is already code examples for this.  Robert will provide the code examples.
5. Create Material in Patran // Robert will provide examples
6. Create Property Cards in Patran  // Robert will provide examples
7. Mesh the model in Patran // Robert will provide examples
8. Apply constraints // Robert will provide examples
9. Apply loads // Robert will provide examples
10. Submit models to solver // Robert will provide examples	


Notes: 
1) Only two modes are supported:  a) Solid models (i.e. Tetra elements b) Surface model (i.e. plate elements (CQuad))
The two modes cannot be combined for now. Either all solids or all plate elements.  For now, the error checking 
should verify that they are not combined.
